If you do not have devtools, install them.

`install.packages("devtools")`

Then, you can install directly from this repository via

`devtools::install_github("victor-navarro/heidi", build_vignettes = TRUE)`

If you managed to build the vignettes, there's a vignette showing the basics of the package in

`vignette("heidi_basics", package = "heidi")`

library(heidi)
heidi_app()
