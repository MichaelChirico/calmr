# heidi

An R-based package to Simulate the Acquisition and Expression of Reciprocal Associations

## Installation

You will need devtools to install this package from github. If you do not have it, run:

`install.packages("devtools")`

Afterwards, you can install directly from this repository via:

`devtools::install_github("victor-navarro/heidi", build_vignettes = TRUE)`

If you managed to build the vignettes, there's a vignette showing the basics of the package in

`vignette("heidi_basics", package = "heidi")`

If you just want to do some quick simulating, launch the visual interface via:

```
library(heidi)
heidi_app()
```
